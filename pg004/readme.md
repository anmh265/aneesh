1. Function checkAnagram() takes in 2 strings as argument.
2. The first check is to check the length of 2 strins. If not equal return false
3. Then in loop the we check if each character in first string is present in other string or not. If present a count variable is incremented
4. At the end of loop the count is checked against any one of the string lenght(since both string lenghts are same). If same then return true(anagram foundd)

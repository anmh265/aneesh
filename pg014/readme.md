1. A function stringPalindrome is defined that accepts a string
2. The string is first converted to lower case
3. Then the string is run through a loop wherein the space and punctuation marks are ignored and stored in a new variabl newStr
4. newStr is then looped through and check if first and last character is same, then 2nd and 2nd last character is same and so on
5. If all checks return true then given string is palindrome else it is not a palindrome
